Drug discovery is one of the most exciting and rapidly advancing areas where AI is making a significant impact. There are continuous new developments, but here are some of the key trends and recent advancements:\n\n**1. AI-Powered Target Identification and Validation:**\n\n*   **Beyond Genomics:** While genomics has been crucial, AI is now integrating multi-omics data (proteomics, metabolomics, transcriptomics) and even real-world evidence from EHRs. This allows for a more holistic understanding of disease mechanisms and the identification of novel drug targets that might not be apparent through traditional methods.\n*   **Predicting \"Druggability\":** AI models are getting better at predicting whether a newly identified target is \"druggable\" – meaning if it's possible to design a molecule that can effectively interact with it. This saves significant time and resources by avoiding targets that are unlikely to yield successful drugs.\n*   **Recent Examples:** Companies are using AI to identify targets for complex diseases like neurodegenerative disorders (Alzheimer's, Parkinson's) and autoimmune conditions by analyzing intricate biological pathways.\n\n**2. Generative AI for Novel Molecule Design:**\n\n*   **\"Designing from Scratch\":** This is a huge area of growth. Instead of screening vast libraries of existing compounds, generative AI models (like GANs and VAEs) can *create* entirely new molecular structures with desired properties. This includes optimizing for efficacy, safety, and even manufacturability.\n*   **De Novo Design:** AI can design molecules tailored to specific protein targets, exploring vast chemical spaces that are inaccessible through traditional synthesis.\n*   **Recent Examples:** Startups are emerging with platforms that can generate millions of novel drug candidates within weeks. We're seeing AI-designed drugs entering preclinical and even early clinical trials.\n\n**3. AI for Predicting Drug Efficacy and Toxicity:**\n\n*   **In Silico Screening:** AI can virtually screen millions of potential drug compounds against a target, predicting their binding affinity and potential therapeutic effects much faster and cheaper than traditional high-throughput screening.\n*   **Predicting Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs):** AI models are being trained on vast datasets of patient data and chemical structures to predict potential side effects and toxicities of new drug candidates *before* they enter human trials. This can help de-risk the development process.\n*   **Recent Examples:** AI is being used to predict liver toxicity, cardiotoxicity, and other common side effects, allowing researchers to modify or discard problematic compounds early.\n\n**4. AI in Clinical Trial Optimization:**\n\n*   **Patient Selection and Stratification:** AI can identify patient subgroups that are most likely to respond to a particular drug, leading to more efficient and successful clinical trials.\n*   **Predicting Trial Success:** AI models can analyze historical trial data to predict the likelihood of success for new trials, helping pharma companies make more informed decisions about which candidates to advance.\n*   **Decentralized Trials:** AI can facilitate remote monitoring and data collection in decentralized clinical trials, making them more accessible and efficient.\n*   **Recent Examples:** AI is being used to identify biomarkers that predict treatment response, optimize trial site selection, and even predict patient dropout rates.\n\n**5. AI for Repurposing Existing Drugs:**\n\n*   **Finding New Uses:** AI can analyze existing drug databases, scientific literature, and patient data to identify drugs approved for one condition that might be effective for treating other diseases. This is a faster and less expensive route to new treatments.\n*   **Recent Examples:** AI has been instrumental in identifying potential drug candidates for COVID-19 and other emerging infectious diseases by screening existing drug libraries.\n\n**Companies and Innovations to Watch:**\n\nMany companies are at the forefront, including:\n\n*   **Insilico Medicine:** Known for its AI-driven drug discovery platform and its rapid advancement of AI-designed drugs.\n*   **Exscientia:** Focuses on AI-driven drug design and has brought several AI-designed molecules into clinical trials.\n*   **Atomwise:** Uses deep learning for structure-based drug discovery.\n*   **Recursion Pharmaceuticals:** Leverages AI and automation to map human cellular biology and discover new treatments.\n*   **Big Pharma:** Companies like Pfizer, Novartis, and AstraZeneca are heavily investing in and partnering with AI drug discovery companies.\n\n**In Summary:**\n\nThe latest developments in AI drug discovery are characterized by a shift from *screening* to *designing*, a deeper integration of diverse biological data, and a focus on predicting efficacy and safety earlier in the process. AI is no longer a futuristic concept in drug discovery; it's a powerful tool that is actively accelerating the pace at which new medicines are being developed.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Tell me more about the second development you found.\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're asking about **Generative AI for Novel Molecule Design**! This is a truly groundbreaking development in drug discovery.\n\nHere's a deeper dive into what it entails:\n\n**The Core Idea: Designing Molecules from Scratch, Not Just Finding Them**\n\nTraditionally, drug discovery involved:\n1.  **Target Identification:** Figuring out what biological molecule (like a protein) is involved in a disease.\n2.  **High-Throughput Screening (HTS):** Testing millions of existing chemical compounds from large libraries to see if any of them bind to the target and have the desired effect. This is like searching for a specific key in a massive keyring.\n3.  **Lead Optimization:** Modifying the most promising \"hits\" from HTS to improve their efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetic properties.\n\nGenerative AI flips this on its head. Instead of searching for a needle in a haystack, it aims to *create* the perfect needle.\n\n**How Generative AI Works in This Context:**\n\nGenerative AI models, particularly **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** and **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)**, are trained on massive datasets of known molecules and their properties. Through this training, they learn the fundamental rules and patterns of chemical structures and how these structures relate to biological activity.\n\nOnce trained, these models can:\n\n1.  **Generate Novel Chemical Structures:** Given a desired set of properties (e.g., \"binds to target X with high affinity,\" \"is non-toxic,\" \"has good oral bioavailability\"), the AI can propose entirely new molecular structures that have never been synthesized before.\n2.  **Explore Vast Chemical Space:** The number of possible drug-like molecules is astronomically large (estimated to be around 10^60). Generative AI can navigate this vast \"chemical space\" far more efficiently than human chemists or traditional computational methods.\n3.  **Optimize for Multiple Criteria Simultaneously:** A significant advantage is the ability to design molecules that satisfy several complex requirements at once – something that is incredibly challenging with traditional iterative optimization. For instance, it can design a molecule that is potent, selective, has a long half-life, and is easily manufactured, all in one go.\n\n**Key Advantages:**\n\n*   **Speed:** Generative AI can propose viable drug candidates in a matter of weeks or months, compared to the years it might take with traditional methods.\n*   **Novelty:** It can discover entirely new classes of molecules that human intuition might not have conceived.\n*   **Efficiency:** By designing molecules with desired properties from the outset, it reduces the need for extensive screening and subsequent optimization cycles.\n*   **Cost-Effectiveness:** While the initial development of AI models is expensive, the speed and efficiency gains can significantly reduce the overall cost of drug discovery.\n\n**\"De Novo\" Design:**\n\nThis process is often referred to as **\"de novo\" drug design** (Latin for \"from the beginning\"). The AI designs the molecule from scratch, tailored to the specific problem.\n\n**Examples of Recent Progress and Applications:**\n\n*   **Companies like Insilico Medicine and Exscientia** are pioneers here. Insilico Medicine, for instance, has developed AI platforms that can identify a target, design a novel molecule, and advance it into preclinical testing at an unprecedented pace. They have publicly stated that some of their AI-designed drugs have moved from target discovery to preclinical candidate nomination in under 18 months.\n*   **Creation of libraries of novel compounds:** AI is used to generate focused libraries of molecules that are highly likely to be effective against a specific target, which are then synthesized and tested.\n*   **Designing molecules with specific binding modes:** Advanced AI can even generate molecules predicted to bind to a target protein in a particular orientation, which can lead to higher specificity and potency.\n\n**Challenges and the Future:**\n\nWhile incredibly promising, there are still challenges:\n\n*   **Experimental Validation:** AI-generated molecules still need to be synthesized and rigorously tested in the lab and in clinical trials to prove their efficacy and safety in humans.\n*   **Data Quality:** The performance of generative models heavily relies on the quality and completeness of the training data.\n*   **Interpretability:** Understanding *why* an AI proposed a particular molecule can sometimes be difficult, which can be a concern for regulatory bodies and chemists.\n\nDespite these challenges, generative AI for molecule design is poised to fundamentally transform drug discovery, leading to faster development of new and more effective treatments for a wide range of diseases. It represents a significant leap from simply finding existing solutions to creating bespoke ones.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Who are the main companies involved in that?\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're asking about the companies at the forefront of **Generative AI for Novel Molecule Design**!

This \"de novo\" design process allows for faster discovery, exploration of vast chemical spaces, and simultaneous optimization for multiple criteria. The agent cited companies like Insilico Medicine and Exscientia as pioneers in this field and mentioned that AI-designed drugs are progressing into preclinical and early clinical trials.

The presence of that special summary `Event` in your session's history is the tangible result of the compaction process.\n\n**Let's recap what you just witnessed:**\n\n1.  **Silent Operation**: You ran a standard conversation, and from the outside, nothing seemed different.\n2.  **Background Compaction**: Because you configured the `App` with `EventsCompactionConfig`, the ADK `Runner` automatically monitored the conversation length. Once the threshold was met, it triggered the summarization process in the background.\n3.  **Verified Result**: By inspecting the session's events, you found the summary that the LLM generated. This summary now replaces the older, more verbose turns in the agent's active context.\n\n**For all future turns in this conversation, the agent will be given this concise summary instead of the full history.** This saves costs, improves performance, and helps the agent stay focused on what's most important.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.5 More Context Engineering options in ADK\n\n#### 👉 Custom Compaction\nIn this example, we used ADK's default summarizer. For more advanced use cases, you can provide your own by defining a custom `SlidingWindowCompactor` and passing it to the config. This allows you to control the summarization prompt or even use a different, specialized LLM for the task. You can read more about it in the [official documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/compaction/).\n\n#### 👉 Context Caching\nADK also provides **Context Caching** to help reduce the token size of the static instructions that are fed to the LLM by caching the request data.
