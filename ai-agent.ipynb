    "# 🎯 AI Career Advisor Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "An intelligent career transition assistant built with Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK).\n",
    "\n",
    "## What This Agent Does\n",
    "\n",
    "This agent helps people navigate career transitions by:\n",
    "1. **Researching** target career paths (skills, resources, market outlook)\n",
    "2. **Creating** personalized action plans (3-phase transition roadmap)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "The system uses a **Sequential Agent** pattern:\n",
    "```\n",
    "User Query → Research Agent → Mentor Agent → Career Plan\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Research Agent**: Uses Google Search to gather information about career transitions\n",
    "**Mentor Agent**: Creates personalized 3-phase action plans based on research\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✅ **Memory Integration**: Remembers context across sessions\n",
    "- ✅ **Structured Output**: Organized research and actionable plans\n",
    "- ✅ **Automated Callbacks**: Saves conversations to memory automatically\n",
    "- ✅ **Error Handling**: Graceful retry logic for API failures\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to Use\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Run all cells in order\n",
    "2. Provide a career transition query (include: current role, experience, target role, time commitment)\n",
    "3. Receive comprehensive research and a personalized action plan\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Query:**\n",
    "> \"I am a Product Manager with 5 years of experience. I want to transition to data science and can dedicate 10 hours per week.\""
