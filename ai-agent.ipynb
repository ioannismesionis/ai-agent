      "    *   **Explore Advanced Topics:** Depending on your interests, delve deeper into areas like:\n",
      "        *   **Advanced Machine Learning:** More complex algorithms, deep learning basics.\n",
      "        *   **Experiment Design & A/B Testing:** Crucial for product-focused data science.\n",
      "        *   **Data Visualization:** Tools like Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Tableau to effectively communicate findings.\n",
      "    *   **Build a Robust Portfolio:** Work on 2-3 substantial personal projects. Aim to showcase a end-to-end data science workflow: problem definition, data cleaning, EDA, model building, evaluation, and interpretation of results in a business context. Consider participating in Kaggle competitions.\n",
      "    *   **Network Actively:**\n",
      "        *   Attend local data science meetups or virtual events.\n",
      "        *   Connect with data scientists and ML engineers on LinkedIn.\n",
