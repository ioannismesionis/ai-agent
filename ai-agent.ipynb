Run all cells in order\n2. Provide a career transition query (include: current role, experience, target role, time commitment)\n3. Receive comprehensive research and a personalized action plan\n\n**Example Query:**\n> \"I am a Product Manager with 5 years of experience. I want to transition to data science and can dedicate 10 hours per week.\"",
