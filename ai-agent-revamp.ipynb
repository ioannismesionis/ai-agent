    "✅ **Single Runner** - No confusion about which runner to use\n",

    "✅ **Flexible** - Works for both interactive (multi-turn) and direct (all-in-one) approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Validated** - Can't proceed without complete, valid profile data\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Memory-Aware** - Checks past conversations via preload_memory\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Robust** - Max iterations prevents infinite loops"
